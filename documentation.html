<h1>RemoteControl Documentation</h1>

<hr>
<h2>Version</h2>

<p>
This is RemoteControl, version 1.1<br>
RemoteControl is freeware.
</p>
<hr>
<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
RemoteControl is an application that allows the user to control a remote PC as if he was seating in front of it. It can be useful if you have a PC with no screen, keyboard or mouse connected, or simply if it is too far away.
</p>

<hr>
<h2>How does it work ?</h2>

<p>
RemoteControl is composed of two parts: a server that is running on the target, and the client that the user interacts with. Once the connection established, the image of the screen is sent to the client that shows it to the user, and the events from the local keyboard and mouse are sent back to the target.
</p>

<hr>
<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>
On the target, you have to run the server (the file RCServer). You call it in the UserBootscript or Netscript, for instance. You also have to put the files RCInputDevice and RCInputFilter in the folders:<br>
<tt>/boot/home/config/add-ons/input_server/devices/<br>
/boot/home/config/add-ons/input_server/filters/</tt><br>
Just drop them on the provided links. You will also have to restart the input server for the changes to take effect:<br>
<tt>/boot/beos/system/servers/input_server -q</tt><br>
The first file allows the server to send the events from the user, and the second is there  to filter the input from the remote keyboard and mouse.
</p>

<hr>
<h2>How to use it ?</h2>

<p>
Once the server is installed and running, launch the client from the terminal with the command:<br>
<tt>RCClient hostname</tt><br>
Where hostname is the name or the IP address of the target. Then, a window should open where you can see the remote screen.
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>The events from the mouse and keyboard can be sent to interact with the remote PC.
<li>It is possible to filter the events generated by the remote mouse and keyboard.
<li>The screen is decomposed in several squares. Only the squares that need to be updated are compressed with the translator of your choice, and sent to the client.
</ul>
