RemoteControl is an application that allows the user to control a remote PC. Useful if you have a PC with no screen, keyboard or mouse connected, or simply if it is too far away.

### Features

* The events from mouse and keyboard can be set to interact with the remote PC
* It is possible to filter events generated by the remote mouse and keyboard.
* The screen is devided into several areas. Only the areas that need to be 
updated are compressed with the translator of your choice and sent to the client.

### How to use it?

Once the server is installed and running, launch the client from Terminal:

```
RCClient <hostname>
```

Where hostname is the name or the IP address of the target.
